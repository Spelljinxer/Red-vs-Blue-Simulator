# Red vs Blue Political Simulator

# Synopsis

```scala
"The game itself is set in a fictitious country where two teams are seeking geopolitical
influence over its population. The population of the country - the green team will either
be voting or not voting, this will later represent the winner of the game. Two major teams
- Red and Blue team, are trying to outclass and outsmart each other by sending
messages that will hopefully influence the voting statuses of each member of the green
population. The Red Team is an authoritarian state with radicalised ideologies that are
similar to an upper-right government. On the other hand, the Blue Team is a democratic
sector, maximising community freedom identical to a bottom-left government . To
elaborate further, let us first take a look at how each team will run. The Red teamâ€™s
inherent goal is to stop as many of the green population from voting by the end of the
game. On the other hand, the Blue team is simply the antithesis of this; in that they are
trying to make as many green members vote by the end of the game. During the game,
each team will take turns distributing their messages across the green population (see
further below). This process will repeat until the Blue team eventually expels all of its
energy, in which the game will end. The winner will be based on the total number of the
voting population contrasted against the total number of the green population."
